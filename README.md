# Project Title: Quantum Secure Email Header Simulation
# Team Members: Jared Wang, Justin Rayford, Mateo Penaloza
# Brief Description: This project is going to demonstrate how we can secure metadata using
#                    quantum methods. To do this we will use QKD and XOR encryption to secure
#                    email header metadata, and simulate it through an Alice, Eve, and Bob
#                    communication channel.
