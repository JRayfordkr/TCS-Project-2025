# TCS-Project-2025
# Project Title: Quantum Secure Email Header Simulation
# Team Members: Jared Wang, Justin Rayford, Mateo Penaloza
# Brief Description:
This project is going to demonstrate how we can secure metadata using quantum methods. To do this we will use QKD and XOR encryption to secure email header metadata, and simulate it through an Alice, Eve, and Bob communication channel.
